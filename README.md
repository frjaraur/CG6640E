A simple python script to get active IPs on LAN managed 
with a CBN CG6640E router model. This script has been 
optimizated to firmware CG6640-3.5.1.10a-SH therefore
using a different firmware version can cause errors.

This script uses two external libs: BeautifulSoup & Selenium
To install the libs try the next commands:

    $> pip beautifulsoup4
    $> pip selenium
